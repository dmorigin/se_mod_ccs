# Carrier Control System

This is a little script for my carrier. The primary job of this script is to align the carrier with the horizen.

## Notice

I'm using parts of the code from Flight Assist from Naosyth. You find this script here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=557293234.

This code is also still a test version. Use it at your own risk ;)
